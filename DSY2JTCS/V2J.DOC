v2g
---

What's New
----------

Quite  a large number of changes have been made in this  version, 
let's  start  with things you don't really need to know about  to 
use the system; features that are in the background.

     Modem hangup routine more persistant to ensure hangup on all 
     modem types.

     C)hange display and msg Areas list made Ctrl-C interuptable.

     Line  Idle  detector.  Daisy  will hangup  if  there  is  no 
     responce for 4.5 minutes.

     The  log file is stored in a temporary file then appended to 
     a main file when ever the user logs off or a submit file  is 
     activated.  A temporary file with the extension .$$$ will be 
     seen on the same drive as the log file.

     User's  name and privilage level is displayed for the  Sysop 
     when any user logs on.


The following are new options and commands.

     Help  level  sensitive  prompt  and help  file  for  message 
     editor, the new help file is HELP6.BBS.

     A '^' meta command in SUB files makes the modem go off-hook, 
     put a '^' (up arrow) character in an otherwise blank line of 
     your  EVENT.?  or  *.SUB file and Daisy will take the  modem 
     go Off-Hook before performing that EVENT or SUB file.

     'Welcome' file displayed before bulletin, this is controlled 
     by the new system option WELOME FILE NAME = <filename>.

     D)ate  command from the Main Menu,  this replaces the  D)ate 
     command of the Sysop menu.  All users may view the date, but 
     only  those users with SET DATE PRIVILAGE LEVEL =  <integer> 
     privilage level can change the date.

     I)nquire search feature in User List Editor, while using the 
     userlist  editor you may enter 'I' to search for a  user  by 
     name or part of name.

     Specify  areas  by  SELECTOR (name) for  S)tats  and  R)enum 
     commands.

     Read original '-' command to chain back from reply.

     List from any line by entering line number in Message Editor 
     mode.

     Parallel keyboards.   When in Spy Mode you may type P or  ^P 
     and  the local keyboard will be activated in  parallel  with 
     the remote keyboard.  Type <Esc> or ^P to deactivate.

     Lock off and No-password-required special user flags.   If a 
     users  password is changed to 'L' then that user is  'locked 
     off'.  If  changed to 'N' then that user is does not need to 
     enter a password.

     IFNA  Kludge  handling.   A new system  option  VIEW  KLUDGE 
     PRIVILAGE LEVEL = <integer> determines if a user can see the 
     IFNA Kludges.

     Dual  purpose  A)nswer command.   A  'A)nswer  Questionnair' 
     command  from the main menu is controlled by the new  system 
     option QUESTION FILE NAME = <filename>.  If this is set to a 
     *.SUB  file  then that SUB file is activated when  the  user 
     selects  'A'.   A file name with any other extension will be 
     taken as a text file and will be displayed.

     New @ commands.  The new @E and @A commands are intended for 
     use  with the 'A' command,  @Exxxx will echo the text 'xxxx' 
     to the log file. And @Axxxx will echo 'xxxx' to the user and 
     allow  the user to input a line,  the input will be  logged. 
     The  @C  command  will  clear send the  users  screen  clear 
     sequence, obviously this only works if he has an intelligent 
     terminal.

v2f

What's New
----------
   
This is mainly a bug-fix release.

     
   Bug fixes
   ---------
     
     The  bug-fix made in v2e was not complete,  it has now  been 
     completed in this version.

   Changes
   -------

     Two  new area privilage levels may be set for areas with  an 
     attribute  of 1,  this are Kill/Sent and FileAttach.  A user 
     with  a  high enough privilage level will  be  prompted  for 
     these flags while entering msgs into a NetMail area.



----------------------------------------------------------------
v2e
---

What's New
----------
   
This is mainly a bug-fix release.

     
   Bug fixes
   ---------
     
     An  error  in  the handling of the Message Text  files  that 
     caused I/O error 91 when reading messages following a "Can't 
     save  all of message" error,  and which could only be  fixed 
     with the message packer, has been fixed.

   Changes
   -------

     As well as the events EVENT.A to EVENT.Z Daisy will now also 
     allow EVENT.0 to EVENT.9.

     When  used with the Mailer package Daisy will check  entered 
     addresses   against   the  nodelist.   The   system   option 
     NODELISTDRIVE, type drive, default nul, must be set for this 
     to function.

     A new system option has been added called FILES DRIVE,  type 
     drive, default null, for use with the external file system.


   Previously un-documented features
   ---------------------------------
     Starting  in  version  2d  of Daisy  the  user  list  editor 
     features  a  JumpFactor,  this  is  a  number  in  []  which 
     indicates how far a left or right movement will go. Typing a 
     number  from 1 to 9 will make the JumpFactor equal  to  that 
     number by ten.


----------------------------------------------------------------
v2d
---

What's New
----------
   
   Versions
   --------
     A version of Daisy is now available for the Time ][ clock 
     card as well as one for the TimeMaster.

     
   Bug fixes
   ---------
     Full selector of To: area may be specified in Hurl.


   Changes
   -------
     If you don't have a clock card then Daisy can estimate the 
     passing of time to give a rough clock. This feature is 
     deactivated by making the last 5 characters of the date/time 
     string a non-valid time.

     The new system option TIME ADJUST, type integer, default 
     100, is used to adjust the estimated clock, smaller values 
     make the clock run faster, larger values make it run slower.

     When a user has a intelligent terminal set on the Change 
     menu then when that user is in the message area the area 
     selector will be displayed in the top righthand corner of 
     the screen as a reminder.

     Input buffering is provided for local users as well as 
     remote users, up to 255 characters may be buffered.

     The new system option SCHEDULAR, type boolean, default 
     FALSE, causes Daisy to be compatible with a time controlled 
     schedular. The schedular is activated via EVENT.D which is 
     reserved for it's use when SCHEDULAR = TRUE. See the 
     documentation on schedular for more details of the schedular 
     conventions.

     The new system option FILER PRIVILAGE LEVEL, type integer, 
     default nul, is to allow compatability with external file 
     handling systems. When this system option is set a new 
     option, 'F' will appear on the main menu, when selected this 
     will automatically activate EVENT.C which is reserved for 
     it's use when a filer is used.

     If the flag "/R" is placed on the command line when calling 
     BBS (e.g. 'C>BBS SYSOPT.BBS     /R') Daisy will boot in 
     returning mode, this is for use after an Event, Outside or 
     Filer. Note that there must be at least 15 characters 
     between "BBS" and "/R" on the command line, use spaces if 
     required. In returning mode no Daisy logo is shown (only the 
     message 'Returning to Daisy' is shown), if the Data Carrier 
     Detect is true, indicating that a user is still on-line 
     after an O)utside or F)ile section command, then the modem 
     is not reset, Daisy will attempt to read the name and 
     baudrate of the user from the LASTUSER.BBS file, if no such 
     file is present it will require a normal logon, otherwise 
     baud rate matching, system logo, and name input are skipped. 
     Only password entry is required to return to the main menu.

     The new system option FIDO WAIT, type integer, default 0, is 
     to facilitate receiving continuous mail from Fido<tm> when 
     Daisy is used with the MAILER package.

     Events A and B are reserved for automatic use by Daisy if it 
     is being used with MAILER. 

     Daisy no longer generates multiple log files, instead at 
     each boot the previous log file is read in and append to. 
     This requires enough space on disk to hold the log twise.

     The T)ype command will not type an open file, the log file, 
     nor any file that is not a text file.

     A new system option LOG ACTIVITY, type boolean, default 
     false, is a new level of logging, it logs various activity 
     of the system including users entering message areas, 
     entering sysop menu. And events being activated.




----------------------------------------------------------------
v2c
---

What's New
----------
   
   Bug fixes
   ---------
   Pagination counter is reset after entering name and password.

   The  error  associated with saving messages  is  detected  and 
   handled.


   Changes
   -------
   The name of an event being activated is displayed.

   At  300 baud the data format expected by Daisy is 8 data bits, 
   1 stop bit, no parity.

   Free text blocks are expressed as a percentage of total blocks 
   in the stats command.

   The  Hurl  command takes the NAME (selector)  of  the  message 
   area, not the number.


----------------------------------------------------------------
v2b
---

What's New
----------
   
   Bug fixes
   ---------

   The maximum length of MSGTXTnn.BBS files is 120K.  The  figure 
   of 250K used in v2a is incorrect and would cause corruption.

   The  user number in the User List Editor now handles  3  digit 
   user numbers correctly.

   It  is  now  possible to enter a terminal width of up  to  127 
   characters as the prompt indicates.

   Leading  and trailing spaces are striped when an  user  enters 
   their name.


   Changes
   -------

   If RAM DRIVE is set a temporary file "TEMPUSER.$$$" is used to 
   speed up access to the userlist file when a user logs on.  You 
   do  NOT need to save this file,  Daisy will generate it  every 
   time it is run.

   The   T)ype command will no longer be confused by the  garbage 
   beyond the EOF mark in a short text file

   More prompts are now sensitive to the user's Help Level.



----------------------------------------------------------------
v2a
---

What's New
----------
   
   Bug fixes
   ---------

   The  bug  associated  with a blank line following a  "@"  meta 
   command in a text file has been fixed.

   The delayed echo bug associated with Y)elling is fixed.


   Changes
   -------

   The  70K text limitation on message area MSGTXT files has been 
   lifted, the limit is now 250K.

   "Spy-mode" now defaults to off when Daisy boots.

   The  T)ype command will only type text files,  a text file  is 
   defined  as any file in which at least the first 128 characters 
   are all printable.

   Files  T)yped now will show '@' meta commands  instead  of 
   performing them.

   Daisy now references AREAS.BBS less frequently.
