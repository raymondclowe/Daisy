
Nodelist compiler for Mailer 0.37              May 20, 1989


In order to get a NODELIST.BBS for your Daisy ,you will need the
file NODELIST.TXT and NODELIST.CTL to do the process.

Things about the nodecomp.com :

  o   It support the latest IFNA nodelist format of Feb 5, 1989.

  o   It will create the 'Help5.bbs' automatically when you
      compile a nodelist. The board which has been identified to
      be 'down' or 'pvt' will not shown in the help5.bbs file.

      You can replace the ready-to-post Help5.bbs with the old
      one directly without any modify.

  o   It can now compile the IFNA standard form of nodelist, which
      you get from any OPUS/Fido board.

      It remain the function to compile the already-changed nodelist
      for Daisy.

      So it is compatible with both nodelist of OPUS or Daisy.

Dial-default    001
Country-code    852
Area-code       3                 <-- Default -1 ,no area code
Dial-prefix     Pulse, #95        <-- any format of the following :
Timezone        +80                 |
Mail-Hour       1700-1800           |    <Extra no.>
Max-baud        2400                |    <Dialing type>
                                    |    <Dialing type>,<Extra no.>
Route-to      162/23 via 162/27     |    <Extra no.>,<Dialing type>

Hold   162/31                       |  notice the comma between the
                                    |  dialtype and extra no.

  o   TimeZone -   The difference between your local time and the Universal
                   Time Standard.  eg. Hong Kong time is UTS + 08:00 hours

                   We only need to take those 4 digits     + 08:00
                   for the use in the nodelist.ctl         ^ ^^ ^
                   So, all we need here is +80.

                   If - 11:30, then we need to take -113
                   for the TimeZone.

  o   Mail-Hour -  Please note that the time is written in 24 hours format
                   with a '-' between the starting and ending time while
                   no colon ':' is needed.

                   Mail-hour correct to the nearest 10 minutes.

                   ps. Mail-hour default to 1700-1800.
