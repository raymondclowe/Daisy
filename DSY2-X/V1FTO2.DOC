Version 1e to v2 Daisy file conversion utility                 January 1988
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Introduction
------------

This program will convert the USERLIST.BBS and MSGINDEX.BBS files from a 
Daisy v1e or v1f system into a form usable by Daisy v2.


Warning
-------
Always work only on backed-up files - these upgrade processes may easily 
lead to accidental corruption of your message files. So BACKUP EVERYTHING 
*before* starting!


File Usage
---- -----
You may rename your files as convenient while upgrading provided you rename 
them to the correct names when finished.

The userlist should be named USERLIST.BBS, the message index file should be 
named MSGINX1.BBS (previously MSGINDEX.BBS) and the message text file 
should be manually renamed to MSGTXT1.BBS (previously MSGTEXT.BBS).


How to use this program
--- -- --- ---- -------
The program will prompt you to select the message index file or the 
userlist upgrade process, chose the one you wish to perform.

It will then ask you for the drive, name and extention of the old file, 
then of the new file. Once both files have been opened data will be copied 
from the old file into the new.
