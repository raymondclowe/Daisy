@M There is more, detailed, help available - do you wish to read it
          Mask string
If you set a Mask string then only those messages containing that string
in their headers will be readable, all others will be treated as deleted
until you set the mask string to nul.

          Repeat Text
Show just the text of the current message, without the header.

          Brief mode
While brief mode is active only the header of messages will be shown,
once you locate a message header you can read its text with the T)ext
command.
@P080

High level users (level 80 or higher) may use the H)url command to 
copy messages from the current area to any other area.
@P100

Users with level 100 privilage may kill any message, even if it is
not to or from him.
