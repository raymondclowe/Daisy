Features
--------

Daisy is designed to behave in a similar fashion to the popular Fido(tm) 
program written by Tom Jennings. Many of the features, commands and the 
general structure are the same. In addition some commands resembling those 
of other BBS, such as Opus and RBBS, are available.

If you are familiar with Fido(tm) BBS system you should have no difficulty 
using Daisy. 


Differences between Daisy and Fido(tm)
----------- ------- ----- --- --------

The biggest difference between Daisy and Fido(tm) is that Daisy has no 
file capability, only messages. 

The basic message area commands are the same, but with some additional 
commands. 


Communication parameters
------------- ----------
Daisy accepts calls at 8 data bits, no parity and 1 stop bit for 1200 baud 
connect, or 7 data bits, even parity and 1 stop bit for 300 baud. Daisy 
will also accept 8N1 at 300 baud.


Once connected pressing <return> or <space> a few times  will activate 
Daisy.


Once you have given your name and password, selecting a password if this is 
your first time on, Daisy will display the main system bulletin, or 
multiple bulletin, then place you at Daisy's Main Menu.



Main Menu
---- ----

From the main menu you can select a number of different options, these are 
C)hange, U)ser list, V)ersion, M)essages, B)ulletin, E)ditorial, Y)ell, 
O)utside and G)oodbye.

(See section below)

User list
---- ----

people whose name contains a specified search string. This command is also 
available while entering messages by entering "?" at the "To: " prompt.

-------

(See section on Multiple Bulletins below)

second paging sequence.

-------

Goodbye
-------
Asks you if you want to disconnect, if you answer Y you will be logged off 
the system.



Change Menu
------ ----
Selecting C from the main menu takes you to the change menu. From here you 
can change a number of different things. The things available are :-

     P : Users password
     L : Help Level
     N : Number of nuls
     W : Width of your terminal screen
     H : Height of your terminal screen
     T : Type of your terminal
     M : "More?"
     S : Single-Key mode

     Q : Quit change menu
     ? : Display help

Terminal type
-------- ----
You can set your terminal to be one of four different types:-

     Dumb      : An unintelligent terminal that doesn't support any screen 
                 controls.

     Soroc     : Soroc IQ 120/140 terminal, or simulator such as Apple 
                 CP/M.

     ANSI      : ANSI capable terminal, such as an IBM with ANSI.SYS 
                 installed. Or a terminal with VT-100 emulation, such as 
                 Procomm.

     DataMedia : Some Apple 80col. cards, you may have to turn all 
                 emulation in your communication software off if you 
                 want to use this.

If you specify a non-Dumb terminal then terminal control sequences will be 
used by Daisy to provide a neat display while reading messages.


Single-Key
----------
If you set this On then all single inputs may be entered without pressing 
<Return>.


To avoid displaying the whole Change menu status display you may use 
stacked input lines from the main menu to alter your user parameters. For 
example "C N 1 Q" would change your nulls to 1, and result only in the 
message "Nulls 1".




Multiple Bulletin
-------- --------
When you select B from the main menu either the bulletin will be displayed, 
or you will be offered a choice of bulletins; the Multiple bulletin.

A multiple bulletin consists of a menu from which you can select one of a 
number of bulletins.





Message section
------- -------
Selecting M from the main menu takes you to the message section and into 
the area in which you were last.

If this is your first time in the message area during the current logon, 
and if there are new messages in this area, you are prompted for a mail 
search. Once this is completed, interrupted, or if you answer N to the mail 
search you will be dropped into the reading menu. 

Unlike Fido(tm) there is no "message menu" in Daisy; instead you go 
directly from the main menu to the message reading menu as you do in Opus. 

Reading messages
------- --------

The message prompt is of the following form

  >[20]"MASK"<B>, 1 - 30, # M B T or ? for help:
  ^  ^   ^    ^       ^      ^-- Some of the available commands
  ^  ^   ^    ^       ^
  ^  ^   ^    ^       ^-- The highest message number
  ^  ^   ^    ^
  ^  ^   ^    ^-- Brief message mode active (optional) 
  ^  ^   ^  
  ^  ^   ^-- Mask string in use (optional)
  ^  ^ 
  ^  ^-- Current message number
  ^
  ^-- Read direction

Read Direction
---- ---------
"<" or ">" indicating the current direction of reading, forwards or 
backwards.

"Current" message
--------- -------
At the beginning of the read command prompt there is a number enclosed by 
square brackets. This is the number of the most recently read message, and 
is the "current" message. When you first enter the message section it will 
indicate the highest message that you have read.

The K)ill message, R)eply to message and T)ext commands work on the current 
message message.

Mask string
---- ------
String used to define what messages are visible; only those containing the 
mask string in their header can be read. The match is case-insensitive. 
(See M)ask command below)

Brief Mode
----- ----
Present when in brief message mode. (See B)rief command below)


Prompt
------
The exact nature of the prompt will depend upon your help level - depending 
upon your privilage level some of the listed options may not be available 
to you, and some options available to you may not be listed.



At the read message command prompt you may enter :-

     A number to display that message number. Or, in Single-Key mode, 
 |   enter "#" followed by the message number. 

     N)ext to read the next message.

     P)revious to read the previous message.

 |   < or > to change the reading direction.

     <CR> to read the next or previous message depending upon the last N or 
     P used.

     * to read the next message after the highest message you have read.

 |   = to read all of the message before or after the current message 
 |   (depending upon the last N or P).

     E)nter will let you enter a message using the message editor.

     R)eply will automatically enter a message addressed to the person whom 
     the current message is from. The subject field is automatically filled 
     out the same as that of the message you are replying to with the 
     addition of a leading "Re:" to indicate that it is a reply.

 |   A)rea allows you to move from one of the Daisy message areas to 
 |   another, by entering a "?" at the prompt for the new area a list of 
 |   available areas can be displayed. 
 |
 |        Each area may be marked "*" indicating that it is a FidoNet Mail 
 |   area or "E" meaning it is an EchoMail area, in addition a "!" (should 
 |   search) mark will appear for each area you have not been into in which 
 |   there are new messages. 
 |
 |        To select a new area you need only enter enough of the selector 
 |   of the new area to distinguish it from all others. If you enter a "!" 
 |   then you will go to the first area which is listed as "!" in the area 
 |   list.

     K)ill may be used to erase the current message provided that the 
 |   message is from you or to you. If you are in single-key mode then you 
 |   are prompted to ensure that you want to kill the message. 

 |   F)ind a message. Search from the highest message down for message 
     headers containing a specified search string. "I" (for inquire) can be 
     used to activate the Find command.

     S)tats to display the highest message number, highest read message 
     number, and the total number of messages. Then Daisy prompts for a 
     repeated Mail search.

 |   M)ask to set the mask string. Once set only those messages containing 
 |   the mask string (case-insensitive match) will be visible, all other 
 |   messages will be treated as though they were deleted. Setting the mask 
 |   string to nul (by entering only a return) will return to normal mode.

 |   B)rief to toggle the Brief message mode. While in brief mode only the 
 |   headers of messages will be displayed, without the following text.

 |   T)ext to display just the text of the current message. Useful while in 
 |   brief mode.


"|" means a command different from the Fido standard or new in this version 
of Daisy.


Control characters
------- ----------
While reading messages the control characters Ctrl-C (or Ctrl-X or Ctrl-K 
or <Esc>) and Ctrl-S may be used to interrupt or pause the display.




Message editor
------- ------
When you enter a message Daisy will automatically fill the "from" field of 
the message header with your name, and if you are replying to a message it 
will also fill out the "to" and "subject" fields. Otherwise you may fill 
out these fields yourself.

View user list
---- ---- ----
If you enter a "?" at the "To:" prompt you will have access to the view 
user list command. This feature is useful if you want to know the exact 
spelling of a persons name.


Once you have entered the messages subject, you have a 73 character field 
to describe the messages subject, you will be able to enter the messages 
text.

Having entered the text you may use the message editors commands:-


C)ontinue :    Continue entering text.

T)o :          Change the "To:" field of the message.

subJ)ect :     Change the "Subj" field of the message.

D)elete :      Delete a line of the message.

I)nsert :      Insert a blank line.

A)bort :       Abort the message.

E)dit :        Edit a line of the message. 

S)ave :        Save the message to disk.

P)riv :        Toggle from Private to Public status.
