Daisy version 2                Installation                    January 1988
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


This manual
-----------

     This manual describes how to install Daisy v2 given only the basic 
release files. 

     If you are setting up Daisy for the first time you will have to read 
the hardware and software installation sections. But if you are just 
upgrading from v1e or v1f (which are file compatible with each other) you 
can skip ahead to the Upgrade Installation section.

     If you are using a previous v1 first upgrade to at least v1e.


READ.ME
-------
Don't forget to read any READ.ME file with the release files - this will 
contain the latest information on the current version.


(Note, this manual refers only to installation of the SSC/External modem 
version of Daisy)

Hardware Installation
-------- ------------

     First of all you must have your hardware set up correctly, a 
configuration slightly different from that which you use for communication 
with BBS will be required.  

     It is presumed that you will have your SSC installed in slot #2 of 
your apple, as this is the correct position for using it as the PUN:/RDR: 
device of Apple CP/M. You must have your SSC set for communications mode, 
not only the DIP switches, but also the jumper block.

     Daisy will set your modem to AutoAnswer when it first starts up so you 
need not set this with DIP switches.

     For Daisy to recognize the caller the modem must send the Data Carrier 
Detect (DCD) signal to the SSC. As the SSC does not accept characters from 
the modem when Data Carrier Detect is false you may have had your modem or 
cable set to continually provide a carrier detect signal regardless of the 
true carrier state. If this is the case then you must remember to change 
your settings so that the correct carrier detect signal is received by the 
SSC.

     If you have problems try running the supplied program HARDWARE.COM, 
this performs tests on your SSC and modem. It detects, and suggests 
remedies for, most configuration faults.


Software Installation
-------- ------------

     The simplest arrangement will be to put the COM and overlay files, 
BBS.COM, BBS.000 and BBS.001, onto any blank floppy. Insert the disk in 
drive A: and start it by entering BBS at the console. 

     A>BBS

     When run Daisy will automatically generate all of the message and user 
files on the logged drive before displaying the sysop level menu. The BBS 
will automatically go into "waiting for caller" mode at this point.

     Daisy will need to use some space on the A: drive, so it should not be 
write-protected, and it should have at least a few K spare, if you are 
going to use Outside or Event then an extra 1 or 2K will be needed.


     See the files SYSOP.DOC for more details on the many different 
possibilities available in the software installation.


HELP! Installation problems
----- ------------ --------

Symptom: Daisy is always "On-line"
-------- -------------------------
Cause:   Daisy is receiving a continuous DataCarrierDetect (DCD) signal.

What to do: Test the state of DCD as received by the SSC, use the program 
HARDWARE.COM, this program performs many tests, including a test on the 
carrier signal.

     If a fault with the carrier signal is reported check the following 
points in your hardware:

     Check the modem DIP switches to see that the modem does not provide a 
     continuous carrier detect (Switch 6 on a Hayes type mode). 

     Check the modem cable to ensure that pin 8 is connected.

     Check that the DIP switches on your SSC are set correctly for 
     communications mode.

     Check that the jumper block on your SSC; the arrow on the block should 
     point towards MODEM, pin 1 of the block should be in the lower left 
     hand position. When the jumper is set correctly you should be using a 
     normal cable (not a nul-modem cable).  








---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Upgrade Installation
------- ------------

     Use the instructions in this section if you have Daisy v1e or v1f 
running, and wish to upgrade to v2.

     If you are willing to just scrap your old message/user files then 
erase those files and continue as indicated in the first time software 
installation section.


Upgrading files
--------- -----
     The user list and message base files of Daisy v1e/f need to be 
processed before it can be used with v2, this processing is done by running 
the supplied conversion program. Read the file V1FTOV2.DOC to see how to do 
the conversion.

File names
---- -----
In v1e/f the drives of the message files were specified in the system 
option command file, in v2 however a new file called AREAS.BBS stores this 
information.

A line reading AREAS DRIVE = d, where d is any valid disk drive, needs to 
be added to your system option command file. Then the sysop on-line system 
menu can be used to control where the message area files should be stored.

See the section in the Sysop manual about system options and the section on 
the A)reas sub-menu of the sysop on-line menu for details.


System files
------ -----
     Once the data files are upgraded you can replace the files BBS.COM, 
BBS.000 and BBS.001 (of v1e/f) with those of v2.


New features
--- --------
     If you have been running a previous version of Daisy be sure to look 
for the many new features in the Sysop and user manual, they are marked 
with the symbol "** New **".
