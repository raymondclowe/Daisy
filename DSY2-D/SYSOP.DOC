Daisy Version 2            Sysops' Documentation               January 1988
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


This manual
-----------

This manual describes the use of the Daisy system from the point of view of 
the system operator, SYSOP, it includes a description of what to expect 
from the system in normal usage, how to use the sysop commands, how to set 
the system options, how to use the various special features, and how to 
maintain the system.


The Sysop screen
--- ----- ------

The use of Daisy, from the point of view of the sysop, centers on the main 
"Sysop screen"; this display shows information needed to run the system and 
allows the sysop to activate some important options. It is divided by 
dashed lines into three parts; the Status line, the Sysop menu, and the 
Display window.

Status Line
------ ----
At the top of the display is the status line, this contains indicator the 
show the status of various parts of the system.

These are "Waiting" (for a caller) or "On-Line", "Off(On)-Hook" and 
"Carrier".

At the extreme right of the status line the current system date will be 
shown, this will only be "correct" if you have a Daisy compatible clock 
installed, otherwise it will be the date string set from the On-line Sysop 
menu.

Sysop Menu
----- ----
In the middle of the screen is the sysop menu, from which you can select 
the various Sysop options.

Display window
------- ------
The lower part of the screen is used as a multi-purpose area for displaying 
information.



Using the Sysop Menu
----- --- ----- ----

This menu is cursor driven, to pick an option you must to move the cursor, 
a '->', to the required option, then use <Return> key to select that 
option.

The cursor can be moved directly to an option by entering the number beside 
that option, or the cursor can be moved using various keys including the 
keys E, S, D and F.





The Sysop Options
--- ----- -------
There are eight options available:-

1)   * Start Local Session, 
2)     Display user information, 
3)     (De-)Activate spy mode, 
4)   * Event,                            
5)     (Don't-)Allow yell, 
6)   * Edit user list, 
7)   * Terminal mode and 
8)     (Don't-)Exit.

* These options may only be activated while Daisy is "Waiting-for-caller"; 
while a user is connected to Daisy they are not available.


Start Local sessions
----- ----- --------
While in the "waiting-for-caller" mode you can start a local session of the 
BBS at the local console, this will produce exactly the same result on your 
screen as you would achieve from logging on using a modem. 

As soon as you use the G)oodbye command from within the BBS you will be 
returned to the sysop level.

The modem will go Off-Hook during the local session, so any callers will 
receive an engaged signal.



Display user information
------- ---- -----------
This will display the name of the presently logged on user or, if there is 
no user logged on, the last user and that users privilage level. Before a 
user has logged on this will display nothing.


(De-)Activate Spy mode
------------- --- ----
This option toggles between the two states, spy mode on, and spy mode off. 
While spy mode is on and there is a user logged on to the system the local 
console will echo what the user is receiving. If there is a user logged on 
when you activate spy mode the display will start at once. But if there is 
no user the sysop menu will remain on-screen until a session is started by 
a user calling.

From spy mode you can de-activate spy mode at any time using the <ESC> key. 
(see more below)


Start Event                                 ** New **
----- -----
Selecting this option lets you transfer control of the computer to one of 
27 possible a sysop defined SUBmit file. (see the section on Outside and 
Event below).


(Don't-)Allow yell
------------- ----
This option toggles the system option (see the section on system options 
below) "Allow yell" on and off.

If the user selects the Y)ell command from the main menu, and allow yell is 
true, then Daisy will start beeping to page the Sysop. You can use the 
Y)ell command from Spy mode (see below) as usual to chat with the user 
regardless of the AllowYell setting. 

Note: What is shown on the menu is the reverse of the current state; Daisy 
is offering you the option of switching from the present state to that 
indicated by option #5.


Edit user list
---- ---- ----
Activate the user list editor.
(see section below)


Terminal mode
-------- ----
Activate the Daisy built-in terminal program. <Esc> returns to the sysop 
menu.


Exit
----
The exit command will take you to the CP/M command line prompt if there is 
no user logged on. If there is a user logged on then a flag will be set 
that will not be acted upon until the user logs off.

If you are waiting to use the system, but do not want to just disconnect a 
user you can select this command. Then the system will go down as soon as 
the user is finished with it.

If you select Exit while a user is on-line, then change your mind, you can 
select the same option, which will have changed to "Don't Exit", to clear 
the exit flag.






Spy Mode 
--- ---- 
While a user is logged on and spy mode is activated, either because it was 
active when the user called or because you used option #3, the local 
display will show everything that the user is seeing on his own terminal.

While in this mode you have two commands available, Y)ell at user, and 
ESC)ape from spy mode.
     

     Y)ell
     -----
     Entering either Y or Ctrl-Y will put you into Yell mode. To exit Yell 
     mode use the <ESC> key. 
   
          While in yell mode you can chat with the logged on user by 
          typing on your keyboard. <CRs> will be inserted to prevent words 
          being split across two lines; this formatting will be performed 
          separately to match both the local and remote terminal widths.

          You need only press <Enter> when you wish your caller to type, a 
          double linefeed is issued to make it clear that you have 
          finished.

     <ESC>ape
     -------
     Pressing the <ESC> key will exit Spy mode and return you to the sysop 
     menu.
     








---------------------------------------------------------------------------


User list Editor
---- ---- ------


Selecting option #6 from the Sysop menu activates the User list editor.

The first record of the user list, number 0, is at once displayed in the 
display window at the bottom of the screen.

You can use the cursor controls to select the user/field, then <Return> 
will select that field to change. 

"K" will delete or undelete that user by adding or removing a lower case 
"d" from the beginning of the first field. 

<ESC> leaves the user list editor and returns you to the Sysop menu. The 
last record remains in the display window for your reference.


The stand alone utility PACKUSER.COM can be used to remove deleted records 
from the userlist to reduce its size.








---------------------------------------------------------------------------


System Option Command File
------ ------ ------- ----

Introduction
------------
     Many of the major features of Daisy are controlled by variables 
internal to Daisy. These are known as the system options, they can be 
changed using the system option command file. 

     This powerful feature allows you to change many of the operating 
characteristics of Daisy.


Command file specification                     ** New **
------- ---- -------------
You may specify the name of the command file from the CP/M command line in 
the following manner -

A>BBS B:MYSETUP.BBS

When no file name is given in the command line tail Daisy will search first 
the current drive and then drive A: for a file called "SYSOPT.BBS", this 
maintains compatibility with previous versions of Daisy.

If Daisy cannot find a command file then default values will be used for 
all of the system options.


Line processing
---- ----------
Blank lines, spaces within lines, and the case of letters are all ignored 
in the command file.

Anything to the right of a semicolon ";" on a line is ignored as a comment.


Parsing
-------
The first symbol on a line is generally the name of the system option that 
will be changed by this command. It is followed by an "=" and then the 
value to be assigned to that system option.

For example the system option "Allow yell" is a boolean value, it can be 
set by a line such as "Allow yell = TRUE". All system options have defaults 
which will be used if the system option is not mentioned in the SYSOPT.BBS.



System Option Definitions
------ ------ -----------

These various system options are defined below in this format.
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
>    SYSTEM OPTION                           Type      Default   <
>    Meaning                                                     <
------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The "Type" may be one of the following three :-

     Boolean        : "true" or "false"

     Integers       : Standard Turbo Pascal integer format

     File names     : Standard CP/M d:filename.ext form where d: and .ext 
                      are optional. If the drive (d:) is not specified then 
                      the logged drive is used.

     Drive          : A single letter in the range A to P indicating a disk 
                      drive.

A default value of "null" means that the value is a blank, this can be 
generated from the command file by having nothing following the "=" on that 
line.


ALLOW NEW USERS                         Boolean   True
If true then when a person with a name that is not on the user list calls 
they will be added to the user list as a new user.

When false such a person is not allowed to register on the system.


ALLOW YELL                              Boolean   False
Sets the initial value of this option, it can be switched from the sysop 
menu. When true users with a high enough privilage level may page the 
operate with the Y)ell command, otherwise they are told that the sysop is 
unavailable.

ignored.


DEBUG
All lines after this are displayed on the local screen as they are read in, 
and as parsed.




Example
-------
This example gives shows the default values of all system options. Note: 
Using this file would have the same effect as have *no* SYSOPT.BBS at all.

On-line Sysop Menu
------- ----- ----


Introduction
------------
To allow for more flexible Sysop functions, and to allow some degree of 
sysop maintenance to be performed by a remote user, Daisy provides a
Remote On-Line Sysop Menu. 


Privilage
---------
To access the Sysop menu a user must have at least the privilage specified 
by the SYSOP MENU PRIVILAGE LEVEL system option, this is 100 by default.


If a user has a high enough privilage level then the command "*" is visible 
in the main menu. Selecting this enters the Sysop Menu.

The commands available to the remote sysop are A)reas, B)uls, R)enum, 
S)tats and Q)uit.


A)reas                                            ** New **
------
This leads you to the Multiple Message Area maintenance menu.
(see section on multiple message areas)

B)uls
-----
Selecting this commands allows the remote sysop to specify, and edit, the 
multiple bulletin list. To use the command a BULLETIN LIST DRIVE must have 
been specified.
(see the section on multiple bulletins for details)


R)enum
------
This command renumbers a message area, it takes approximately 1 minute per 
100 messages, plus an additional time to update the userlist that varies 
depending upon the length of that list.

Daisy will prompt you to enter the number of the area to be renumbered. The 
renumber process takes three passes during which a rotating indicator lets 
you know that Daisy is working.


S)tats
------
Daisy will prompt you to enter the number of the area for which you want 
statistics. This command displays a number of useful pieces of information 
concerning the selected message area.

Of particular importance are the usage figures for the message files; by 
monitoring these it is possible to know when to kill or renumber the 
messages to prevent the message files from growing.


D)ate                                   ** New **
-----
This lets you enter a 15 character date string that is used to time stamp 
messages. You must input exactly 15 characters, the recommended format is 
"01-Jan-88 00:00" or "01 Jan 88 00:00".

If you are using Daisy with a clock card then this option will only display 
the current time.


T)ype                                   ** New **
-----
Display a text file. Only minimal error checking on the filename or the 
file is performed.


Q)
--
Entering Q, or return alone, exits the Sysop menu.











---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

Multiple Message Areas                       ** New **
-------- ------- -----


Introduction
------------
Daisy Version 2 now supports multiple message areas, each area functions in 
a very similar fashion to the single area in previous versions of Daisy.

The additions to handle the multiple areas consists of the A command on the 
message read menu to change message areas, the H)url command to move 
messages from area to area, and the A) option on the on-line sysop menu to 
perform area maintenance.


Areas command
----- -------
The area command that allows users to switch from one message are to 
another are explained fully in the user manual.


Hurl
----
While at the read message prompt this command will copy the current message 
to another area. Daisy will prompt you for the area number to which you 
wish to copy the message - if you wish to you might then Kill the original 
message thereby "moving" the message.

If you are Hurling to a net mail area Daisy will prompt you to address the 
message to a net/node, and gives you the option to set or clear the Sent 
flag. Hurling a message from "Sysop" to a netmail area gives the option to 
change the name to something more meaningful on another board.


A file called AREAS.BBS, stored on the drive specified by the sysopt AREAS 
DRIVE, contains a record for every message area.


A)reas Maintenance
------ -----------
If a user has a high enough privilage level (more or equal to AREAS MAINT 
PRIVILAGE LEVEL) he can access the Areas maintenance menu from the On-Line 
sysop menu. This menu provides access to the data stored in AREAS.BBS, and 
lets the sysop set and edit the settings.

The commands then available are L)ist to display the current areas, A)dd to 
a new message area record, E)dit to set up or modify the parameters for an 
area, and Q) to quit.




Area Parameters
---- ----------
Selector
   A single word up to 14 characters long that is used to chose that area 
from the area menu.

Name
   The full name of the area.

Index Drive
   The drive on which the MSGINXnn.BBS file is stored.

Text Drive
   The drive on which the MSGTXTnn.BBS file is stored.

Access priv 
   The privilage level required to access this area, the area is not 
available to a user with a privilage level less than this.

E)nter priv
   The privilage level required to enter a message in that area, this 
includes R)eplies.

K)ill priv
   The privilage level required for a user to kill a message to or from 
themselves.

Kill any priv
   Privilage level required to kill any message, regardless of who it is to 
or from.

Read private priv
   Privilage level required to read all messages, regardless of private 
status. Note: If this privilage level is less than the access privilage 
level for the area then it is *not* possible to enter private messages in 
that area.

Hurl from priv
   Privilage level required to use the Hurl command from that area.

Attribute
   This may take a value of 0, 1 or 2. "0" is a normal message area, "1" is 
a net mail area, and "2" is an echo mail area. (Note: Netmail and Echomail 
require the user of the separate MAILER package which at the time of 
writing is not yet released)



Once you have entered/changed the perameters of an area Daisy will then 
prompt "Okay to save changes" giving you a chance to back out of any 
changes you may have made.

In practice you will often use this command simply to check the settings of 
a particular area - in this case always select "N" to the final prompt to 
prevent any accidental changes to the AREAS.BBS file.











---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

Multiple Bulletins
-------- ---------


Introduction
------------
In addition to the normal bulletin file, which is similar to the editorial 
file, Daisy supports Multiple Bulletins.

This feature is activated by using the system option BULLETIN LIST DRIVE. 
If a drive is specified then a file is stored on that drive containing the 
information required to display multiple bulletins.


Bulletin Menu
-------- ----
When the multiple bulletin feature is selected by the user, usually via the 
B command from the main menu, a Bulletin Menu is displayed. This menu is 
taken from a text file that the Sysop provides.


Selectors
---------
Each of the different bulletins has a "selector", this is a single 
character that, when entered by the user, will cause that bulletin to be 
displayed.


Exit selector
---- --------
This is a special selector used to Exit from the Multiple Bulletin. 

If set to "*" the multiple bulletin will "auto exit"; entering return alone 
will exit, and after displaying a single bulletin the function will exit. 

Otherwise the menu is re-displayed after a bulletin is viewed.



Bulletin List
-------- ----
The bulletin list is a file, on the drive specified by BULLETIN LIST DRIVE, 
that contains a list of the different files together with their selectors 
available that make up the multiple bulletin.

The bulletin list also stores the name of the bulletin menu, and the exit 
selector.



B)uls
-----
By selecting B from the remote on-line Sysop menu you can add to or alter 
the bulletin list.




Alternatives combinations
------------ ------------
There are four different combinations of bulletins, the first two are the 
same as those available in previous versions of Daisy. The latter two 
involve the use of Multiple Bulletins.


1.   If neither multiple bulletin nor a bulletin file are specified then no 
     bulletin is displayed at log-on and the B command from the main menu is 
     not available.

2.   If only a bulletin file is specified then the bulletin file displayed 
     at log-on, and can be re-displayed by selecting the B command from the 
     main menu.

3.   If both a bulletin file and a multiple bulletin are specified then the 
     bulletin file is displayed at log-on, with the multiple bulletin 
     available via the B command from the main menu.

4.   If only a multiple bulletin is specified then the multiple bulletin is 
     offered at log-on, and also available via the B command from the main 
     menu.









---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Text File Meta Commands                ** New *:
---- ---- ---- --------
In the various text files that Daisy may display, such as bulletins and 
help files, you may use special "Meta commands" to control the display.

Each command is a single line with the "@" character in the first position 
on that line.


Commands
--------

@
Do not display anything after this.

@L 
Do not issue a linefeed after displaying the next line.

@M xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
Pause and prompt "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx? [Y,n]", if the user responds 'N' no more 
of the file will be displayed, otherwise display will continue.

@Pnnn
Only display after this line if the user's privilage level is at least nnn.

@PnnnS
Skip the next line if the user's privilage level is less than nnn.














---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Outside and Event
------- --- -----

These two facilities, introduced in version 1d of Daisy, allow programs and 
commands external to Daisy to be activated.

The two functions are grouped together because they both work the same way, 
the major difference between them is that Outside is a user activated 
feature, while Event is a sysop activated one.


Submit files
------ -----
What these two function do is to read in a specified file, containing 
commands that you want performed, and converting them into a $$$.SUB files. 
This is the same feature of CP/M as that used by the SUBMIT command. 

(If the CP/AM sysopt is set true the Daisy will use the special SUBMIT 
format required by CP/AM systems)     ** New **

Don't worry if you are already calling Daisy from a submit file; Daisy will 
append the new commands to the old ones, the new commands begin performed 
first.


Multiple Events                                  ** New **
-------- ------
On the event drive you can have as many files as you want named EVENT.d 
where d is a letter from A to Z. Each of these can be activated from the 
Sysop menu by entering the appropriate letter.

Note: Events A to F are reserved by Daisy, and may be used automatically by 
the system. 



Format
------
Each submit file should be standard ASCII files contain lines such as those 
you would type in to the CCP:-

DIR
B:
A:BBS

These are all valid lines.

Unlike SUBMIT Daisy does not convert ^x into a control character, and there 
is no facility for $n options.


Don't forget that to use this facility you must have room on your A: drive 
to hold the $$$.SUB file, and it must of course not be write protected.


In order to return control to Daisy don't forget to re-start BBS as the 
last line in your Outside and Event files.



CHAIN Meta command
----- ---- -------
If the first word of the first line of a SUBMIT file is "CHAIN" Daisy 
treats that first line as a special meta command. 

The filename following "CHAIN" will be activated using the Turbo Pascal 
Chain feature (it must therefore obviously be a Turbo Pascal .CHN file). 
The text following the filename, up to 80 characters, will be passed to the 
calling program as the first available memory variable of type STRING[80]. 

Any subsequent lines, such as "BBS" to return to Daisy, will be treated 
normally.







---------------------------------------------------------------------------


System Maintenance
------ -----------


System maintenance consists of performing general file maintenance on the 
system files, including backing up and ensuring that the disk media is 
error free.


File maintenance
---- -----------
Daisy makes use of a number of disk files, these form the "history" and the 
character of your BBS they are very important if you are running a BBS.

User file
---- ----
This file is where Daisy maintains a record of all the callers to your 
system, it allows Daisy to remember the name, password, and various 
preferences of each user.

By using the user list editor, described above, which is available from the 
Sysop main menu, you can edit the user list. 

The utility program PACKUSER.COM can be used to remove deleted records from 
the user list, and also to recover from a corrupted userlist. See the 
documentation of that program for details.


Message files
------- -----
To keep the size of the message files to a reasonable size it is important 
to regularly kill old messages. It is wise to encourage the users to 
occasional go though the message base killing old messages to or from 
themselves (which is very easy if they set Mask to their name), but this 
cannot be relied upon to be enough.

So you should give yourself the privilage level high enough to kill any 
message (100 by default) so that you can then kill unnecessary messages 
yourself.

Killing messages frees up the space they used in the message text file, and 
so will stop it getting bigger, but it won't make it smaller.

The space taken up by the message headers in the message index file will, 
however, not be released until you renumber the messages. This scrunches 
all of the deleted message headers out.

This will not make the file smaller, but will stop it growing until the 
message numbers reach the point at which they where before you renumbered.



In addition to these three required files there are a number of optional 
files, though they are not required it is a good idea to use them as they 
help to give your BBS character.


Logo, Bulletin and Editorial
----  -------- --- ---------
The system logo will probably stay constant once you have determined what 
you are going to use as your logo, but be sure to keep any system 
information you put in the logo up-to-date as your users will tend to 
consider this as a source of information.

If you use a bulletin it can be used to provide general information of 
interest to your users. (see also the section on Multiple-Bulletins)

You can use the editorial to spell out any points of interest concerning 
your BBS.

All these files should be in normal ASCII; with no high bits set, use a 
normal editor to generate these files.


Help files
---- -----
There are a number of help files, called HELP?.BBS, located on a drive 
specified by SYSOPT.BBS. An example is given in the release files, but you 
may wish to change it to suit the needs of your users and the privilage 
level system you chose to use.




Backing up files
------- -- -----
To protect against accidental loss of data, because of a disk crash or some 
system bug damaging the message base, you will want to do regular backups 
of the user and message files.

The files you need to backup are AREAS.BBS, MSGINXnn.BBS, MSGTXTnn.BBS and 
USERLIST.BBS. You should, of course, also have backups of the main system 
files BBS.COM, BBS.000 and BBS.001.

It is very important to keep regular backups of your data files; following 
a disk crash you may have to fall back to the previous backup.



Physical Disk Maintenance
-------- ---- -----------
Because of the way CP/M handles disk errors it is very important that they 
never occur while Daisy is being used.

Because CP/M errors wait for input from the local console Daisy will, from 
the users point of view, freeze if a disk error ever occurs.

So make sure that the floppy disks you use for your Daisy files are of a 
good quality, and are clean and not worn out. If you have any problems with 
them copy the files to a new disk and use that instead.
