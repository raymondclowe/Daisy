Daisy Version 2                Introduction                    January 1988
---------------------------------------------------------------------------


This manual
-----------

This is the documentation file and manual for the Daisy Bulletin Board 
System version 2 which originated as part of the Programming Project 2.


Programming Projects
----------- --------
The Programming Projects are intended to encourage the writing of software 
for the public domain. In particular they aim to encourage cooperation 
between various people who are interested in programming as a hobby. We 
write these programs for fun and the experience rather than for any profit.

The programming project number two was to design a BBS system to run on an 
Apple ][ CP/M system.



Daisy
-----
Daisy is a powerful and flexible (not to mention large and complex) 
Bulletin Board system, it is written in Turbo Pascal v2.


Operating requirements
--------- ------------
To run the Daisy BBS you will need the following:-

     An Apple ][ Computer with 64K.
     A Z80 CP/M card.

     A Super Serial Communications card.
     An external 300/1200 baud AutoAnswer modem.
or
     A MicroModem II compatible internal 300 baud modem.

The PP2 definition also calls for a 128K card, although this is not 
presently required by Daisy it is highly recommended as a RAM disk for high 
speed loading of the program overlays. In addition the more available disk 
drives the better.

Some clock cards can be supported. 




Daisy Features and Capabilities
----- -------- --- ------------

Daisy allows an Apple system as defined above to be used as a messaging 
system by users remote from the Apple who call up Daisy via modem links.

Its features include :

   o Restricted access to the system using a list of users and their 
     passwords.

 * o Up to 20 separate message areas.

   o Powerful message reading commands.
     
   o Help files available at various points of the system.

   o Intelligent terminal support for Soroc, ANSI, VT-100 and DataMedia 
     terminals.

   o Multiple bulletins in addition to a main bulletin and editorial.

   o Local sessions of the BBS from the local console.

   o Sysop Spy mode and Yell features. 

   o Built-in user list editor.

   o A Sysop created system option command file to control BBS features.
  
   o Remote on-line sysop maintenance menu, available to high level users.

   o A built-in terminal mode called from the local sysop menu.

 * o Multiple external "Events".

 * o Date/time support, including Real time Clocks.

Those features marked thus "*" are new in version 2 of Daisy.



Authors
-------
Daisy was written in a collaborative effort by Raymond Lowe and Ken Lo. 


Acknowledgement
---------------
The authors would like to thank the many people who have provided help and 
ideas for Daisy. In particular we wish to thank Simmons Kwan who started 
the first 24hour Daisy BBS and who contributed his considerable programming 
skill to our efforts.



Reports
-------
If you find any problems with Daisy, particularly anything that could be 
described as a "bug" please inform the authors by addressing a message to 
us on Dial-A-Net (FidoNet/Matrix 3:700/4), Daisy-Information-Gateway (DIG) 
or any Hong Kong BBS on which you see our names.

If you do get a Daisy system working we would also like to know, to judge 
how easy (or hard) it is to get the system working. Many thanks for any 
feedback you can give us.

Any questions, comments, suggestions, or commercial inquiries are welcomed 
by the authors.
