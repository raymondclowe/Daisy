v2.5                     Message Utility                 2 Jan 89
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Introduction
------------

The  message utility allows the Sysop to perform bulk erasure  of 
messages and to compact message files.

It   supports   a   script  feature  allowing   it   to   operate 
automatically.

This  new  version has a new option in the  'Pack  Message  Area' 
command  which  allows the sysop to specify the number of  latest 
messages  to be retained.  In case the number is larger than  the 
number of messages in the area, all messages are retained.

Usage
-----
MSGUTIL  MUST be called using the CHAIN command from a Daisy BBS, 
an optional script filename may be passed.

1)   CHAIN MSGUTIL.CHN 

2)   CHAIN MSGUTIL.CHN script.txt

In  form 1 the utility will be activated and you may  select  the 
menu options to perform the various commands.

If  you  use form 2 and the script file exists the  utility  will 
take  commands from the text file script.txt.   If the file  does 
not  exist the utility will work as for form 1 but will copy  all 
operations into the script file.

Therefore to create a script use form 2,  MSGUTIL will then be in 
a  'learn'  mode,  and perform manually the operation you want  a 
script for.

Once  the  operation  is complete Quit the  system,  when  it  is 
started  again  the  script file will be read and used  as  input 
automatically performing the same operations.
